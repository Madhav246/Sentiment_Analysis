as early as i could remember myself, my memories have been colored with melancholy and sad feelings. yes, i admit it: i am a person who loves being sad. as a child, i loved gloomy fairy tales; as a teenager, i loved tragic novels and films, which made my parents worry a lot. i realized that i did not meet their expectations: in their ideal world, a happy person must irradiate joy all the time. in my view, this state of constant life enjoyment looked slightly idiotic. and i kept asking myself if sadness is really so bad.
